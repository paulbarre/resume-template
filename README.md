# resume-template

## About

A fully responsive template I created and used for my own resume.

Feel free to use, change or do whatever with it. (A link to this page would be appreciated but I leave it to your own judgement).

## Example

[Here](https://paulbarre.github.io/resume-template/) is what it looks.

## Credits

This template uses the following:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)

Flags for localization have been generated with [Flag Sprites](https://www.flag-sprites.com/).

The library used for internalization is [webL10n](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webL10n).
